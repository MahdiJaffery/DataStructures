## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of common data structures in C++, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. Each data structure is implemented with explanations and examples to help you understand how they work and how to use them effectively.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
- **Hash Tables**
  - Linear Hashmaps
  - Quadratic Hashmaps

Each implementation is located in its respective directory, and detailed comments are included in the code to provide explanations.
